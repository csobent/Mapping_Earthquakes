# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview: Purpose of this repository.
In this challenge, we were required, using JavaScript, HTML, Leaflet, and CSS, to create maps with different overlays and markers. Specifically, our focus was to create a map with different options of all earthquakes in the past 7 days, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes. Also, to make our accentuate our maps, we added overlays to show different styles. Showing all earthquakes or only major earthquakes in relation to the tectonic plates should provide ample information to those trying to find patterns in earthquakes.
